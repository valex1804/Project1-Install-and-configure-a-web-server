# Project1-Install-and-configure-a-web-server

🚀 This represents my first project, where I implemented a virtual machine that functions as a web server.
I implemented and documented the necessary configuration steps, applying my knowledge in system administration, security, backups, and an automation script for the backup process.
The purpose of this project was to apply my Linux and Python knowledge and to implement them practically in this project.

The web page component is very basic since the focus was not on this aspect. However, I plan to revisit and improve it in the future.
Additionally, I will provide updates to this project, particularly in the areas of security, backup, and the web page.

⚙️ Configuration used:

VM Software: VirtualBox

OS: Ubuntu Server version 24.04.1 LTS

2048 MB RAM

25.00 GB for the OS

5.00 GB additional hard disk for backup

Custom partitioning for Ubuntu Server:
⛃ / (filesystem): 12 GB ,
⛃ Swap space: 2x RAM (4 GB) ,
⛃ /boot: 100 MB ,
⛃ /home: 5 GB ;

👉 In conclusion, this project gave me confidence to tackle real-world scenarios. I realized that mistakes are part of the learning process, and solving them step by step helps me grow.
